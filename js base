Prgramming language - Brendan Eich in 1995, Follows standards ECMA-262, Programs you write in JS are called Scripts which are written
                      in web page's HTML and run automatically when page loads.
                      
                    - Initially named as LiveScript later JS, Initially It was supposed to follow the concepts of Java for browese
                      client side handling, but later It started to follow its own convention ECMAScript.
                    
                    How It works 
                    - Browsers render HTMLs, they have embedded engine to run scripts associated.
                      Eg: Chrome has V8 engine.
                          Firefox has SpiderMonkey.
                          IE- Trident    
                    
                    - Engine reads the scripts, and convert to machine codes then after memory allocation happens.
                    - JS - Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.
                         - React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
                         - Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).
                         - Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
                         - Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”)
                     
                    - JS Restrictions - JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on the hard disk, 
                                        copy them or execute programs. It has no direct access to OS system functions.
                                         
                                      - Not possible to communicate over tabs, scripts running in one tab are meant for that tab 
                                        only, like xyz.com in tab can not communicate to scripts open in abc.com.
                                        
                     
    - Client-Server Communication - Web browsers and web servers function together as a client-server system. 
                                    In computer networking, client-server is a standard method for designing applications 
                                    where data is kept in central locations (server computers) and efficiently 
                                    shared with any number of other computers (the clients) on request. 
                                    All web browsers function as clients that request information from websites (servers). 
                                    
                                  - The user specifies a URL in their browser (either from a bookmark or by typing it in)
                                  - The browser initiates a TCP connection to the web server or server pool (using port 80 by default) 
                                    via its IP address as published in DNS. 
                                    As part of this process, the browser also makes DNS lookup requests to convert the URL to an IP address.
                                    
                                  - DNS - Browser searches www.google.com.
                                        - Local/company DNS is checked, whether able to find address.
                                        - ISP DNS is checked and finds the address.
                                        - Root DNS is checked and finds the address and sends it browser back, and browser loads that
                                          address.
                                  - After the server completes acknowledgment of its side of the TCP connection, 
                                    the browser sends HTTP requests to the server to retrieve the content.
                                    
                                  - After the server replies with content for the page, the browser retrieves 
                                    it from the HTTP packets and displays it accordingly.
                                    Content can include embedded URLs for advertising banners or other third-party content, 
                                    that in turn triggers the browser to issue new TCP connection requests to those locations. 
                                    The browser may also save temporary information about its connections to local files 
                                    on the client computer called cookies.
                          
                                  - Any errors encountered during the request for the content might be shown as HTTP status lines.

      - Optimizing the websites can be by activating flags from server like - cache-control: public/private/no-cache.
      
 - Variable declartion/function deflaration

 - Datatypes - Primitive - Number, Boolean, String, Symbol, Null, Undefined. //Brief on typeof
             - Collection - Object
             
             Functions are first class first class functions in JS, respected the most and can be used as class with specifying methods, models
inside it either directly or prototype.

Criteria - return, naming convention, arguments

When a Function Declaration is made within a code block, it is visible everywhere inside that block. But not outside of it.

function abc (){
  return "somename";
}

function clearance(){
				var node = document.createElement("LI");                 // Create a <li> node
				var textnode = document.createTextNode("Water");         // Create a text node
				node.appendChild(textnode);                              // Append the text to <li>
				document.body.appendChild(node); 
}


Unary, Binary
--------------------------------
Mathematical operation happens in BODMAS

Concatenation - 1+ "1" // "11"  "1" + 1 // "11"
              - 2 + +"2" //4
              - 4 + 4 + "soumya" // 8soumya
              - +"" // 0 - "" is falsy
              - +true //1 - true is equal to 1
              - true + false // 1
              - true + true // 2
              - n = 0, n += 1 // means n = n + 1

Negative - 1 - 1 //0
         - 4 - "2" //2
         - "2" - 3 //1
         - "4" - "8" //4
         - +"2"+"4"-"7" //-1

Division - "6" / "2" //3

Assignment - a = b = c = 2 // a=2, b=2, c=4

Remainder - 5 % 2 //1

Multiplication - - ** // a ** b is a multiplied by itself b times. or a to the power b.
                 - 4 ** (1/2) //2 gives the squere root
                 - 8 ** (1/3) //2 gives the cube root

Comparsion - == value comparison
           - === value and data type comparison

Increment/Decrement - let a = 1, b = 1;
                    - let c = ++a; //  a =2, c =2
                    - let d = b++; // b = 2, d =1

comma - (1,2,3) -- checks all the values and returns the last.

OR and AND operator - 3 || 4 return 3// takes positivity 
                    - 0 || 0 || 1 // checks 0 which is falsy checks second and finally meets 1
                    - 10 && 9 // keeps on traversing and gets the last value.
                    
Bitwise Shift Operator - left - 5 << 2 //000101 << 2 // two bits shifted left //0010100 = 20
                         right - 5 >> 2 // 000101 >> 2 // two bits shifted right //000001 = 1
                        
Bitwise - a |= b - or 00101 |= 00001 = 5
        - a ^= b - xor - a.b(bar) + b.a(bar)
        -
